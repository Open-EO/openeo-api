      The URL of the API MAY freely be chosen by the back-end providers. The
      path, including API versioning, is a *recommendation* only. Nevertheless,
      all servers MUST support HTTPS as the authentication methods are not
      secure with HTTP only!

          API versioning is RECOMMENDED. As the openEO API is following
          [SemVer](https://semver.org/) only the MAJOR part of the stable
          version numbers (i.e. versions >= 1.0.0) SHOULD be used for API
          versioning in the URL. The reason is that backward-incompatible
          changes are usually introduced by major changes. Therefore, the
          version number in the URL MUST not be used by the clients to detect
          the version number of the API. Use the version number returned from
          `GET /` instead.

        It is **strongly RECOMMENDED** to keep the response size small by
        omitting all optional non-scalar values from objects in `orders` (e.g. `parameters`).
        To get the full metadata for an order clients MUST request `GET /orders/{order_id}`.

        Create an order for selected items (products).

        When an order is created through through this endpoint, the data isn't yet ordered from the commercial data provider. The client MUST explicitly confirm the order through `POST /orders/{order_id}` whereupon the order is executed.
        
        The order can contain additional parameters that specify how the items should be delivered.
        For example, it might be possible to set the projection, resampling method, bit depth etc. of the delivered data.

        Backends SHOULD expose the available ordering parameters in `GET /collections/{collection_id}` in the `order_parameters` field, following the `process_parameters` schema of [`GET /service_types`](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/api/reference.html#tag/Secondary-Services/operation/list-service-types). 

        Returns `Location` and `OpenEO-Identifier` header with the link to the detailed information about the order.

        Confirm the order, execute the purchase and ingest the data into a target collection.

        When an order is created through `POST /order`, the data isn't yet ordered from the commercial data provider. The client MUST explicitly confirm the order whereupon the order is executed, the costs are deducted from the client's account and the data is ingested in the target collection.

        The target collection is the collection through which the ordered data is made available. The source and the target collection can be the same or different, it's up to the backend if the ordered data id ingested into a new target collection or the existing source collection. Additionally, if the backend creates new target collections, it can provide access to the union of all purchased products through the source collection.

        This endpoint only has an effect if `order:status` is `orderable`.
        
        If the user doesn't have sufficient funds, the endpoint should return an error and `order:status` should not change.
        
        Otherwise, the `order:status` changes from `orderable` to `ordered` until a new order status (e.g. `succeeded` or `failed`) becomes available.
