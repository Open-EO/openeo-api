### Changed

- `mime_type` replaced with `media_type` in the process catalogue input parameters and return values.
- The schema for `exceptions` defined in process descriptions (`GET /processes`) follows the general schema for openEO errors.
- The `name` property of processes has changed its name to `id` for consistency. [#130](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/130)
- The `name` property of files has changed its name to `path` for consistency. [#133](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/133)
- `POST /validation` returns HTTP status code 200 for valid and invalid process graphs and responds with a list of errors. [#144](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/144)
- `version` in response of `GET /` renamed to `api_version`.
- Added authentication information where missing and allowed to call `POST /validation` without authentication. [#151](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/151)

### Removed
- Numeric openEO error codes. Replaced in responses with textual error codes. [#139](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/139)
- Removed the query parameters to replace process graph variables in `GET /process_graphs/{process_graph_id}`. [#147](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/147)

### Fixed

## [0.3.1] - 2018-11-06

### Added
- `createProcessGraph` method to client development guidelines.
- JSON file with all specified errors.
- Textual error codes for each specified error.
- Allow setting a plan for `POST /preview`
- Default billing plan in `GET /`. [#141](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/141)
- Job ID in JSON response for `GET /jobs/{job_id}/results`.

### Changed
- Several optional fields such as `output`, `title` and `description` are now nullable instead of requiring to omit them.
- The output format is not required in `POST /preview` any more and thus allows falling back to the default.
- The `output_format` parameter in `createJob` and `execute` in client development guidelines.
- The `extent` parameters in `filter_bbox` and `filter_daterange` are formally required now.

### Deprecated
- Numeric openEO error codes are soon to be replaced with textual error codes.
- `eo:resolution` in collection bands is a duplicate of `eo:gsd`. Use `eo:gsd` instead.
