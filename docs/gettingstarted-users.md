# Getting started for users

Currently, there are three official client libraries and a web-based interface for openEO.

If you are **unfamiliar** with programming, you could start using the [web-based editor for openEO](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-web-editor/demo/). It supports visual modelling of your algorithms and a simplified JavaScript based access to the openEO workflows and providers. 

If you are **familiar** with programming, you could choose a client library for three programming languages:

* [JavaScript](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-js-client) (client-side and server-side)
* [Python](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-client)
* [R](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-r-client)

Follow the links above to find usage instructions for each of the client libraries.

Didn't find your programming language? You can also access the [openEO API](apireference.md) implementations directly or start implementing your own client library. Feel free to contact us for further assistance.
