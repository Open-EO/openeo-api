# Client library development guidelines

This is a proposal for workflows that client libraries should support to make the experience with each library similar and users can easily adopt examples and workflows.

For best experience libraries should still embrace best practices common in their environments. This means clients can...

* choose which kind of casing they use (see below). 
* feel free to implement aliases for methods.

## Conventions

### Casing

Clients can use `snake_case`, `camelCase` or any method used commonly in their environment. For example, the API request to get a list of collections can either be names `get_collections` or `getCollections`. This applies for all names, including scopes, method names and parameters.

### Scopes

Methods usually have a different scope, in object-oriented (OO) programming methods would be part of a class. If programming languages don't have functionalities to scope you may need to simulate it somehow to prevent name collisions. Best practices for this will likely evolve over time.

Example for the `version` method in `openEO`:

* Procedural style: `openeo_version()` 
* OO style:
  ```java
  OpenEO obj = new OpenEO();
  obj.version();
  ```

If you can't store scope data in an object, you may need to pass these information as argument(s) to the method.

Example:

* Procedural style:
  ```php
  $connection = openeo_connect("https://openeo.org");
  openeo_get_capabilities($connection);
  ```
* OO style:
  ```java
  OpenEO obj = new OpenEO();
  Connection con = obj.connect("https://openeo.org");
  con.getCapabilities();
  ```

There are three types of scopes: 

* Root (only the scope `openEO`).
* API (mostly methods hiding API calls). These may be implemented asynchronously. Method names across root and API scopes MUST be unique.
* Content (mostly methods hiding the complexity of request and response content, i.e. JSON objects). Usually synchronously implemented. Method names should be prefixed if name collisions are likely. See the `Capabilities` scope for an example.

### Parameters

The parameters usually follow the request schemas in the openAPI specification. The parameters should follow their characteristics, for example regarding the default values.

Some methods have a long list of (optional) parameters. This is easy to implement for languages that support named parameters such as R. Other languages may have problems implementing this natively as they need to fill many parameters with default values. For example creating a job in R with a budget would lead to such a method call: `createJob(process_graph = ..., null, budget = 123)`, but in PHP it would be: `createJob(..., null, null, null, null, null, 123)`. This is not an ideal behaviour, therefore client developers might want to consider passing parameters in coupled in a dictionary or class to emulate named parameters. The example in PHP could be improved to `createJob([process_graph => ..., null, budget => 123])`.

**ToDo:** Allow sorting and other useful operations for lists?

## Method mappings

**Note:** Subscriptions and some scopes for response JSON objects are still missing. We are open for proposals.

Parameters with a leading `?` are optional.

### Scope `Capabilities` (Content)

Should be prefixed with `Capabilities` if required. In non-object-oriented paradigms it is likely required as `version()` in this scope and the scope `OpenEO` could collide. For example, `version()` in this scope could be named `openeo_capabilities_version()` in procedural style.

## Processes

The processes a back-end supports may be offered by the clients as methods in its own scope. The method names should follow the process names, but the conventions listed above can be applied here as well, e.g. converting `filter_bands` to `filterBands`. As parameters have no natural or technical ordering in the JSON objects, clients must come up with a reasonable ordering of parameters if required. This could be inspired by existing clients. The way of building a process graph from processes heavily depends on the technical capabilities of the programming language. Therefore it may differ between the client libraries. Follow the best practices of the programming language, e.g. support method chaining if possible.

## Workflow example

Some simplified example workflows using different programming styles are listed below. The following steps are executed:

1. Loading the client library.
2. Connecting to a back-end and authenticating with username and password via OpenID Connect.
3. Requesting the capabilities and showing the implemented openEO version of the back-end.
4. Showing information about the "Sentinel-2A" collection.
5. Showing information about all processes supported by the back-end.
6. Building a simple process graph.
7. Creating a job.
8. Pushing the job to the processing queue.
9. After a while, showing the job details, e.g. checking the job status.
10. Once processing is finished, downloading the job results to the local directory `/tmp/job_results/`.

### R (functional style)

```r
library(openeo)

con = connect("https://openeo.org", "username", "password")
cap = capabilities()
cap %>% version()
con %>% describeCollection("Sentinel-2A")
con %>% listProcesses()

pgb = con %>% pgb()
processgraph = pgb$getCollection(name = "Sentinel-2A") %>% 
  pgb$filterBbox(east = 652000, west = 672000, north = 5161000, south = 5181000, srs = "EPSG:32632") %>%
  pgb$filterDaterange(extent = c("2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2017-01-31T23:59:59Z")) %>%
  pgb$NDVI(nir = "B4", red = "B8A") %>%
  pgb$minTime()
process_graph = con %>% toJSON(processgraph)

job = con %>% createJob(processgraph)
job %>% startJob()
job %>% describeJob()
job %>% downloadResults("/tmp/job_results/")
```

### Python (mixed style)

```python
import openeo

con = openeo.connect("https://openeo.org", "username", "password")
cap = con.capabilities()
print cap.version()
print con.describe_collection("Sentinel-2A")
print con.list_processes()

processes = con.get_processes();
pg = processes.get_collection(name = "Sentinel-2A");
pg = processes.filter_bbox(pg, east = 652000, west = 672000, north = 5161000, south = 5181000, srs = "EPSG:32632")
pg = processes.filter_daterange(pg, extent = ["2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2017-01-31T23:59:59Z"])
pg = processes.NDVI(pg, nir = "B4", red = "B8A")
pg = processes.min_time(pg)

job = con.create_job(pg.graph)
job.start_job()
print job.describe_job()
job.download_results("/tmp/job_results/")
```

### Java (object oriented style)

```java
import org.openeo.*;

OpenEO obj = new OpenEO();
Connection con = obj.connect("https://openeo.org", "username", "password");
Capabilities cap = con.capabilities();
System.out.println(cap.version());
System.out.println(con.describeCollection("Sentinel-2A"));
System.out.println(con.listProcesses());

ProcessGraphBuilder pgb = con.getProcessGraphBuilder()
// Chain processes...
ProcessGraph processGraph = pgb.buildProcessGraph();

Job job = con.createJob(processGraph);
job.startJob();
System.out.println(job.describeJob());
job.downloadResults("/tmp/job_results/");
```

### PHP (procedural style)

```php
require_once("/path/to/openeo.php");

$connection = openeo_connect("http://openeo.org", "username", "password");
$capabilities = openeo_capabilities($connection);
echo openeo_capabilities_version($capabilites);
echo openeo_describe_collection($connection, "Sentinel-2A");
echo openeo_list_processes($connection);

$pg = openeo_process($pg, "get_collection", ["name" => "Sentinel-2A"]);
$pg = openeo_process($pg, "filter_bbox", ["east" => 652000, "west" => 672000, "north" => 5161000, "south" => 5181000, "srs" => "EPSG:32632"]);
$pg = openeo_process($pg, "filter_daterange", ["extent" => ["2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2017-01-31T23:59:59Z"]]);
$pg = openeo_process($pg, "NDVI", ["red" => "B4", "nir" => "B8A"]);
$pg = openeo_process($pg, "min_time");

$job = openeo_create_job($connection, $pg);
openeo_start_job($job);
echo openeo_describe_job($job);
openeo_download_results($job, "/tmp/job_results/");
```
