    The openEO API specification for interoperable cloud-based processing of large Earth observation datasets.

    # API Principles

    ## Language

    In the specification the key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174).

    ## Casing

    Unless otherwise stated the API works **case sensitive**.

    All names SHOULD be written in snake case, i.e. words are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with all letters lower-cased. Example: `hello_world`. This applies particularly to endpoints and JSON property names. HTTP header fields follow their respective casing conventions, e.g. `Content-Type` or `OpenEO-Costs`, despite being case-insensitive according to [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

    ## HTTP / REST

    This uses [HTTP REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) [Level 2](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2) for communication between client and back-end server.

    Public APIs MUST be available via HTTPS only. 
    
    Endpoints are made use meaningful HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) whenever technically possible. If there is a need to transfer big chunks of data for a GET requests to the back-end, POST requests MAY be used as a replacement as they support to send data via request body. Unless otherwise stated, PATCH requests are only defined to work on direct (first-level) children of the full JSON object. Therefore, changing a property on a deeper level of the full JSON object always requires to send the whole JSON object defined by the first-level property.

    Naming of endpoints follow the REST principles. Therefore, endpoints are centered around resources. Resource identifiers MUST be named with a noun in plural form except for single actions that can not be modelled with the regular HTTP verbs. Single actions MUST be single endpoints with a single HTTP verb (POST is RECOMMENDED) and no other endpoints beneath it.

    ## JSON

    The API uses JSON for request and response bodies whenever feasible. Services use JSON as the default encoding. Other encodings can be requested using [Content Negotiation](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html). Clients and servers MUST NOT rely on the order in which properties appears in JSON. Collections usually don't include nested JSON objects if those information can be requested from the individual resources.

    ## Web Linking
    
    The API is designed in a way that to most entities (e.g. collections and processes) a set of links can be added. These can be alternate representations, e.g. data discovery via OGC WCS or OGC CSW, references to a license, references to actual raw data for downloading, detailed information about pre-processing and more. Clients should allow users to follow the links.

    Whenever links are utilized in the API, the description explains which relation (`rel` property) types are commonly used.
    A [list of standardized link relations types is provided by IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) and the API tries to align whenever feasible.

    Some very common relation types - usually not mentioned explicitly in the description of `links` fields - are:
    
    1. `self`: which allows link to the location that the resource can be (permanently) found online.This is particularly useful when the data is data is made available offline, so that the downstream user knows where the data has come from.

    2. `alternate`: An alternative representation of the resource, may it be another metadata standard the data is available in or simply a human-readable version in HTML or PDF.

    3. `about`: A resource that is related or further explains the resource, e.g. a user guide.

    ## Error Handling

    The success of requests MUST be indicated using [HTTP status codes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) according to [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

    If the API responds with a status code between 100 and 399 the back-end indicates that the request has been handled successfully.

    In general an error is communicated with a status code between 400 and 599. Client errors are defined as a client passing invalid data to the service and the service *correctly* rejecting that data. Examples include invalid credentials, incorrect parameters, unknown versions, or similar. These are generally "4xx" HTTP error codes and are the result of a client passing incorrect or invalid data. Client errors do *not* contribute to overall API availability. 

    Server errors are defined as the server failing to correctly return in response to a valid client request. These are generally "5xx" HTTP error codes. Server errors *do* contribute to the overall API availability. Calls that fail due to rate limiting or quota failures MUST NOT count as server errors. 

    ### JSON error object

    A JSON error object SHOULD be sent with all responses that have a status code between 400 and 599.

    ``` json
    {
      "id": "936DA01F-9ABD-4D9D-80C7-02AF85C822A8",
      "code": "SampleError",
      "message": "A sample error message.",
      "url": "https://example.openeo.org/docs/errors/SampleError"
    }
    ```

    Sending `code` and `message` is REQUIRED. 

    * A back-end MAY add a free-form `id` (unique identifier) to the error response to be able to log and track errors with further non-disclosable details.
    * The `code` is either one of the [standardized textual openEO error codes](errors.json) or a proprietary error code.
    * The `message` explains the reason the server is rejecting the request. For "4xx" error codes the message explains how the client needs to modify the request.

      By default the message MUST be sent in English language. Content Negotiation is used to localize the error messages: If an `Accept-Language` header is sent by the client and a translation is available, the message should be translated accordingly and the `Content-Language` header must be present in the response. See "[How to localize your API](http://apiux.com/2013/04/25/how-to-localize-your-api/)" for more information.
    * `url` is an OPTIONAL attribute and contains a link to a resource that is explaining the error and potential solutions in-depth.

    ### Standardized status codes

    The openEO API usually uses the following HTTP status codes for successful requests: 

    - **200 OK**:
      Indicates a successful request **with** a response body being sent.
    - **201 Created**
      Indicates a successful request that successfully created a new resource. Sends a `Location` header to the newly created resource **without** a response body.
    - **202 Accepted**
      Indicates a successful request that successfully queued the creation of a new resource, but it has not been created yet. The response is sent **without** a response body.
    - **204 No Content**:
      Indicates a successful request **without** a response body being sent.

    The openEO API has some commonly used HTTP status codes for failed requests: 

    - **400 Bad Request**:
      The back-end responds with this error code whenever the error has its origin on client side and no other HTTP status code in the 400 range is suitable.

    - **401 Unauthorized**:
      The client did not provide any authentication details for a resource requiring authentication or the provided authentication details are not correct.

    - **403 Forbidden**:
      The client did provided correct authentication details, but the privileges/permissions of the provided credentials do not allow to request the resource.

    - **404 Not Found**:
      The resource specified by the path does not exist, i.e. one of the resources belonging to the specified identifiers are not available at the back-end.
      *Note:* Unsupported endpoints MUST use HTTP status code 501.

    - **500 Internal Server Error**:
      The error has its origin on server side and no other status code in the 500 range is suitable.


    If a HTTP status code in the 400 range is returned, the client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. For HTTP status code in the 500 range, the client MAY repeat the same request later.

    All HTTP status codes defined in RFC 7231 in the 400 and 500 ranges can be used as openEO error code in addition to the most used status codes mentioned here. Responding with openEO error codes 400 and 500 SHOULD be avoided in favor of any more specific standardized or proprietary openEO error code.

    ## Temporal data

    Date, time, intervals and durations are formatted based on ISO 8601 or its profile [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339) whenever there is an appropriate encoding available in the standard. All temporal data are specified based on the Gregorian calendar.

    # Authentication

    The openEO API offers two forms of authentication by default:
    * OpenID Connect (recommended) at `GET /credentials/oidc`
    * Basic at `GET /credentials/basic`
      
    After authentication with any of the methods listed above, the tokens obtained during the authentication workflows can be sent to protected endpoints in subsequent requests.
    
    Further authentication methods MAY be added by back-ends.

    # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

    > Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources [...] on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. [...]
    > CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether or not it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.
    
    Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
    
    openEO-based back-ends are usually hosted on a different domain / host than the client that is requesting data from the back-end. Therefore most requests to the back-end are blocked by all modern browsers. This leads to the problem that the JavaScript library and any browser-based application can't access back-ends. Therefore, all back-end providers SHOULD support CORS to enable browser-based applications to access back-ends. [CORS is a recommendation of the W3C organization](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). The following chapters will explain how back-end providers can implement CORS support.

    **Tip**: Most servers can send the required headers and the responses to the OPTIONS requests automatically for all endpoints. Otherwise you may also use a proxy server to add the headers and OPTIONS responses.
    
    ## CORS headers
    
    The following headers MUST be included with every response:
    
    | Name                             | Description                                                  | Example |
    | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Origin      | Allowed origin for the request, including protocol, host and port or `*` for all origins. It is RECOMMENDED to return the value `*` to allow requests from browser-based implementations such as the Web Editor. | `*` |
    | Access-Control-Expose-Headers    | Some endpoints require to send additional HTTP response headers such as `OpenEO-Identifier` and `Location`. To make these headers available to browser-based clients, they MUST be white-listed with this CORS header. The following HTTP headers are white-listed by browsers and MUST NOT be included: `Cache-Control`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified` and `Pragma`. At least the following headers MUST be listed in this version of the openEO API: `Link`, `Location`, `OpenEO-Costs` and `OpenEO-Identifier`. | `Link, Location, OpenEO-Costs, OpenEO-Identifier` |
    
    
    
    ### Example request and response
    
    Request:
    
    ```http
    POST /api/v1/jobs HTTP/1.1
    Host: openeo.cloudprovider.com
    Origin: https://client.org:8080
    Authorization: Bearer basic//ZXhhbXBsZTpleGFtcGxl
    ```
    
    Response:
    
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, OpenEO-Identifier, OpenEO-Costs, Link
    Content-Type: application/json
    Location: https://openeo.cloudprovider.com/api/v1/jobs/abc123
    OpenEO-Identifier: abc123
    ```
    
    ## OPTIONS method
    
    All endpoints must respond to the `OPTIONS` HTTP method. This is a response for the preflight requests made by web browsers before sending the actual request (e.g. `POST /jobs`). It needs to respond with a status code of `204` and no response body.
    **In addition** to the HTTP headers shown in the table above, the following HTTP headers MUST be included with every response to an `OPTIONS` request:
    
    | Name                             | Description                                                  | Example |
    | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Headers     | Comma-separated list of HTTP headers allowed to be sent with the actual (non-preflight) request. MUST contain at least `Authorization` if any kind of authorization is implemented by the back-end. | `Authorization, Content-Type` |
    | Access-Control-Allow-Methods     | Comma-separated list of HTTP methods allowed to be requested. Back-ends MUST list all implemented HTTP methods for the endpoint. | `OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE` |
    | Content-Type                     | SHOULD return the content type delivered by the request that the permission is requested for. | `application/json` |
    
    ### Example request and response
    
    Request:
    
    ```http
    OPTIONS /api/v1/jobs HTTP/1.1
    Host: openeo.cloudprovider.com
    Origin: https://client.org:8080
    Access-Control-Request-Method: POST 
    Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
    ```
    
    Note that the `Access-Control-Request-*` headers are automatically attached to the requests by the browsers.

    Response:
    
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, OpenEO-Identifier, OpenEO-Costs, Link
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```

    # Processes

    A **process** is an operation that performs a specific task on a set of parameters and returns a result. An example is computing a statistical operation, such as mean or median, on selected EO data. A process is similar to a function or method in programming languages. In openEO, processes are used to build a chain of processes ([process graph](#section/Processes/Process-Graphs)), which can be applied to EO data to derive your own findings from the data.

    A **pre-defined process** is a process provided by the *back-end*. There is a set of predefined processes by openEO to improve interoperability between back-ends.
    Back-ends SHOULD follow these specifications whenever possible. Not all processes need to be implemented by all back-ends. See the **[process reference](https://processes.openeo.org)** for pre-defined processes.

    A **user-defined process** is a process defined by the *user*. It can directly be part of another process graph or be stored as custom process on a back-end. Internally it is a *process graph* with optional additional metadata.

    A **process graph** chains specific process calls from the set of pre-defined and user-defined processes together. A process graph itself can be stored as a (user-defined) process again. Similarly to scripts in the context of programming, process graphs organize and automate the execution of one or more processes that could alternatively be executed individually. In a process graph, processes need to be specific, i.e. concrete values or "placeholders" for input parameters need to be specified. These values can be scalars, arrays, objects, references to parameters or previous computations or other process graphs.

    ## Defining Processes

    Back-ends and users MAY define new proprietary processes for their domain. 
    
    **Back-end providers** MUST follow the schema for predefined processes as in [`GET /processes`](/#tag/Process-Discovery) to define new processes. This includes:

    * Choosing a intuitive process id, consisting of only letters (a-z), numbers and underscores. It MUST be unique across the pre-defined processes.
    * Defining the parameters and their exact (JSON) schemes.
    * Specifying the return value of a process also with a (JSON) schema.
    * Providing examples or compliance tests.
    * Trying to make the process universally usable so that other back-end providers or openEO can adopt it.
    
    **Users** MUST follow the schema for user-defined processes as in [`GET /process_graphs`](/#tag/User-Defined-Processes) to define new processes. This includes:

    * Choosing a intuitive name as process id, consisting of only letters (a-z), numbers and underscores. It MUST be unique across the user-defined processes.
    * Defining the algorithm as a process graph.
    * Optionally, specifying the additional metadata for processes.

    If new process are potentially useful for other back-ends the openEO consortium is happily accepting [pull requests](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/pulls) to include them in the list of pre-defined processes.

    ### Schemas

    Each process parameter and the return values of a process define a schema that the value MUST comply to. The schemas are based on [JSON Schema draft-07](http://json-schema.org/).

    Two custom keywords have been defined:
    * `subtype` for more fine-grained data-types than JSON Schema supports.
    * `parameters` to specify parameters that processes can pass to other process graphs.

    ### Subtypes

    JSON Schema allows to specify only a small set of native data types (string, boolean, number, integer, array, object, null).
    To support more fine grained data types, a custom [JSON Schema keyword](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.6.4) has been defined: `subtype`.
    It works similarly as the JSON Schema keyword [`format`](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.7) and defines a number of subtypes for the native data types.
    These should be re-used in process schema definitions whenever suitable.
    
    If a general data type such as `string` or `number` is used in a schema, all subtypes with the same parent data type can be passed, too.
    Clients should offer make passing subtypes as easy as passing a general data type.
    For example, a parameter accepting strings must also allow passing a string with subtype `date` and thus clients should encourage this by also providing a date-picker.

    A list of predefined subtypes is available as JSON Schema in [openeo-processes](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes).

    ## Process Graphs

    As defined above, a **process graph** is a chain of processes with explicit values for their parameters.
    Technically, a process graph is defined to be a graph of connected processes with exactly one node returning the final result:

    ```
    <ProcessGraph> := {
      "<ProcessNodeIdentifier>": <ProcessNode>,
      ...
    }
    ```

    `<ProcessNodeIdentifier>` is a unique key within the process graph that is used to reference (the return value of) this process in arguments of other processes. The identifier is unique only strictly within itself, excluding any parent and child process graphs. Process node identifiers are also strictly scoped and can not be referenced from child or parent process graphs. Circular references are not allowed.

    Note: We provide a non-binding [JSON Schema for basic process graph validation](assets/pg-schema.json).

    ### Processes (Process Nodes)

    A single node in a process graph (i.e. a specific instance of a process) is defined as follows:

    ```
    <ProcessNode> := {
      "process_id": <string>,
      "namespace": <string> / null,
      "description": <string>,
      "arguments": <Arguments>,
      "result": true / false
    }
    ```
    A process node MUST always contain key-value-pairs named `process_id` and `arguments`. It MAY contain a `description`.

    One of the nodes in a map of processes (the final one) MUST have the `result` flag set to `true`, all the other nodes can omit it as the default value is `false`. Having such a node is important as multiple end nodes are possible, but in most use cases it is important to exactly specify the return value to be used by other processes. Each child process graph must also specify a result node similar to the "main" process graph.

    `process_id` MUST be a valid process ID in the `namespace` given. Clients SHOULD warn the user if a user-defined process is added with the same identifier as one of the pre-defined process.

    ### Arguments

    A process can have an arbitrary number of arguments. Their name and value are specified 
    in the process specification as an object of key-value pairs:

    ```
    <Arguments> := {
      "<ParameterName>": <string|number|boolean|null|array|object|ResultReference|UserDefinedProcess|ParameterReference>
    }
    ```

    **Notes:**
    - The specified data types are the native data types supported by JSON, except for `ResultReference`, `UserDefinedProcess` and `ParameterReference`.
    - Objects are not allowed to have keys with the following reserved names:

        * `from_node`, except for objects of type `ResultReference`
        * `process_graph`, except for objects of type `UserDefinedProcess`
        * `from_parameter`, except for objects of type `ParameterReference`

    - Arrays and objects can also contain a `ResultReference`, a `UserDefinedProcess` or a `ParameterReference`. So back-ends must *fully* traverse the process graphs, including all children.

    ### Accessing results of other process nodes

    A value of type `<ResultReference>` is an object with a key `from_node` and a `<ProcessNodeIdentifier>` as corresponding value:

    ```
    <ResultReference> := {
      "from_node": "<ProcessNodeIdentifier>"
    }
    ```

    This tells the back-end that the process expects the result (i.e. the return value) from another process node to be passed as argument.
    The `<ProcessNodeIdentifier>` is strictly scoped and can only reference nodes from within the same process graph, not child or parent process graphs.

    ### User-defined process

    A user-defined process in a process graph is a child process graph, to be evaluated as part of another process.

    **Example**: You want to calculate the absolute value of each pixel in a data cube.
    This can be achieved in openEO by executing the `apply` process and pass it
    a user-defined process as the "operator" to apply to each pixel.
    In this simple example, the "child" process graph defining the user-defined process
    consists of a single process `absolute`, but it can be arbitrary complex in general.

    A `<UserDefinedProcess>` argument MUST at least consist of an object with a key `process_graph`.
    Optionally, it can also be described with the same additional properties available for pre-defined processes such as an id, parameters, return values etc.
    When embedded in a process graph, these additional properties of a user-defined process are usually not used, except for validation purposes.

    ```
    <UserDefinedProcess> := {
      "process_graph": <ProcessGraph>,
      ...
    }
    ```

    ### Accessing process parameters

    A "parent" process that works with a user-defined process can make so called *process graph parameters*
    available to the "child" logic.
    Processes in the "child" process graph can access these parameters by passing a `ParameterReference` object as argument.
    It is an object with key `from_parameter` specifying the name of the process graph parameter:

    ```
    <ParameterReference> := {
      "from_parameter": "<ParameterReferenceName>"
    }
    ```

    The parameter names made available for `<ParameterReferenceName>` are defined and passed to the process graph by one of the parent entities.
    The parent could be a process (such as `apply` or `reduce_dimension`) or something else that executes a process graph (a secondary web service for example).
    If the parent is a process, the parameter are defined in the [`parameters` property](#section/Processes/Defining-Processes) of the corresponding JSON Schema.

    In case of the example given above, the parameter `process` in the process [`apply`](https://processes.openeo.org/#apply) defines two process graph parameters: `x` (the value of each pixel that will be processed) and `context` (additional data passed through from the user).
    The process `absolute` expects an argument with the same name `x`.
    The process graph for the example would look as follows:

    ```
    {
      "process_id": "apply",
      "arguments": {
        "data": {"from_node": "loadcollection1"}
        "process": {
          "process_graph": {
            "abs1": {
              "process_id": "absolute",
              "arguments": {
                "x": {"from_parameter": "x"}
              },
              "result": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    `loadcollection1` would be a result from another process, which is not part of this example.

    **Important:** `<ParameterReferenceName>` is less strictly scoped than `<ProcessNodeIdentifier>`.
    `<ParameterReferenceName>` can be any parameter from the process graph or any of its parents.

    The value for the parameter MUST be resolved as follows:
    1. In general the most specific parameter value is used. This means the parameter value is resolved starting from the current scope and then checking each parent for a suitable parameter value until a parameter values is found or the "root" process graph has been reached.
    2. In case a parameter value is not available, the most unspecific default value from the process graph parameter definitions are used. For example, if default values are available for the root process graph and all children, the default value from the root process graph is used.
    3. If no default values are available either, the error `ProcessParameterMissing` must be thrown.

    ## Data Processing

    Processes can run in three different ways:

    1. Results can be pre-computed by creating a ***batch job***. They are submitted to the back-end's processing system, but will remain inactive until explicitly put into the processing queue. They will run only once and store results after execution. Results can be downloaded. Batch jobs are typically time consuming and user interaction is not possible although log files are generated for them. This is the only mode that allows to get an estimate about time, volume and costs beforehand.
    
    2. A more dynamic way of processing and accessing data is to create a **secondary web service**. They allow web-based access using different protocols such as [OGC WMS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms), [OGC WCS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs), [OGC API - Features](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features) or [XYZ tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames). Some protocols such as the OGC WMS or XYZ tiles allow users to change the viewing extent or level of detail (zoom level). Therefore, computations often run *on demand* so that the requested data is calculated during the request. Back-ends should make sure to cache processed data to avoid additional/high costs and reduce waiting times for the user.
    
    3. Processes can also be executed **on-demand** (i.e. synchronously). Results are delivered with the request itself and no job is created. Only lightweight computations, for example previews, should be executed using this approach as timeouts are to be expected for [long-polling HTTP requests](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/2014-12-01-http-long-polling/).

    ### Validation

    Process graph validation is a quite complex task. There's a [JSON schema](assets/pg-schema.json) for basic process graph validation. It checks the general structure of a process graph, but only checking against the schema is not fully validating a process graph. Note that this JSON Schema is probably good enough for a first version, but should be revised and improved for production. There are further steps to do:

    1. Validate whether there's exactly one `result: true` per process graph.
    2. Check whether the process names that are referenced in the field `process_id` are actually available in the corresponding `namespace`.
    3. Validate all arguments for each process against the JSON schemas that are specified in the corresponding process specifications.
    4. Check whether the values specified for `from_node` have a corresponding node in the same process graph.
    5. Validate whether the return value and the arguments requesting a return value with `from_node` are compatible.
    7. Check the content of arrays and objects. These could include parameter and result references (`from_node`, `from_parameter` etc.).


    ### Execution

    To process the process graph on the back-end you need to go through all nodes/processes in the list and set for each node to which node it passes data and from which it expects data. In another iteration the back-end can find all start nodes for processing by checking for zero dependencies.

    You can now start and execute the start nodes (in parallel, if possible). Results can be passed to the nodes that were identified beforehand. For each node that depends on multiple inputs you need to check whether all dependencies have already finished and only execute once the last dependency is ready.

    Please be aware that the result node (`result` set to `true`) is not necessarily the last node that is executed. The author of the process graph may choose to set a non-end node to the result node!

      The following endpoints handle user profiles, accounting and authentication. See also [Authentication](#section/Authentication). In general, the openEO API only defines a minimum subset of user management and accounting functionality. It allows to

      * [authenticate and authorize](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-authentication-and-authorization/) a user, which may include [user registration with OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html),
      * handle storage space limits (disk quota),
      * manage billing, which includes to
          * query the credit a user has available,
          * estimate costs for certain operations (data processing and downloading),
          * get information about produced costs,
          * limit costs of certain operations.

      Therefore, the API leaves some aspects open that have to be handled by the back-ends separately, including 

      * credential recovery, e.g. retrieving a forgotten password
      * user data management, e.g. changing the users payment details or email address
      * payments, i.e. topping up credits for pre-paid services or paying for post-paid services
      * other accounting related tasks, e.g. creating invoices,
      * user registration (except for [user registration with OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)).
  - name: EO Data Discovery
    description: |-
      These endpoints allow to list the collections that are available at the back-end and can be used as data cubes for data processing.

      ## STAC
      
      For data discovery of Earth Observation Collections at the back-ends, openEO strives for compatibility with the specifications [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/) and [OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) as far as possible. Implementing the data discovery endpoints of openEO should also produce valid STAC API 0.9.0 and OGC API - Features 1.0 responses, including ([partial](#provide-data-for-download)) compatibility with their APIs. 

      The data discovery endpoints `GET /collections` and `GET /collections/{collection_id}` are compatible with OGC API - Features and STAC. Both specifications define additional endpoints that need to be implemented to be fully compatible. The additional endpoints can easily be integrated into an openEO API implementation. A rough list of actions for compatibility is available below, but please refer to their specifications to find out the full details.

      **Important:** [STAC specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) and [STAC API](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec) are different specifications and have different version numbers after version 0.9.0.
      The openEO API only implements [STAC API version 0.9.0](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/v0.9.0/api-spec/README.md), which allows to serve all STAC specification versions in the range of 0.9.x and 1.x.x (see the `stac_version` property).
      
      ### Content Extensions
      
      STAC has several [extensions](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions) that can be used to better describe your data. Clients and server are not required to implement all of them, so be aware that some clients may not be able to read all your metadata.
      
      Some commonly used extensions that are relevant for datasets exposed through the openEO API are:
      
      - Data Cube extension (part of the openEO API)
      - [EO (Electro-Optical) extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/eo)
      - [SAR extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/sar)
      - [Satellite extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/sat)
      - [Scientific extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/scientific)
      
      ### Provide data for download
      
      If you'd like to provide your data for download in addition to offering the cloud processing service, you can implement the full STAC API. Therefore you can implement the endpoints `GET /collections/{collectionId}/items` and `GET /collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}` to support retrieval of individual items. To benefit from the STAC ecosystem and allow searching for items you can also implement `POST /search` and `GET /search`. Further information can be found in the [STAC API repository](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/api-spec).

      The URL of the API MAY freely be chosen by the back-end providers. The
      path, including API versioning, is a *recommendation* only. Nevertheless,
      all servers MUST support HTTPS as the authentication methods are not
      secure with HTTP only!

          API versioning is RECOMMENDED. As the openEO API is following
          [SemVer](https://semver.org/) only the MAJOR part of the stable
          version numbers (i.e. versions >= 1.0.0) SHOULD be used for API
          versioning in the URL. The reason is that backward-incompatible
          changes are usually introduced by major changes. Therefore, the
          version number in the URL MUST not be used by the clients to detect
          the version number of the API. Use the version number returned from
          `GET /` instead.

                      the service provider or the terms of service.

                      It is highly RECOMMENDED to provide links with the
                      following `rel` (relation) types:

                      1. `version-history`: A link back to the Well-Known URL
                      (see `/.well-known/openeo`) to allow clients to work on
                      the most recent version.

                      2. `terms-of-service`: A link to the terms of service. If
                      a back-end provides a link to the terms of service, the
                      clients MUST provide a way to read the terms of service
                      and only connect to the back-end after the user agreed to
                      them. The user interface MUST be designed in a way that
                      the terms of service are not agreed to by default, i.e.
                      the user MUST explicitly agree to them.

                      3. `privacy-policy`: A link to the privacy policy (GDPR).
                      If a back-end provides a link to a privacy policy, the
                      clients MUST provide a way to read the privacy policy and
                      only connect to the back-end after the user agreed to
                      them. The user interface MUST be designed in a way that
                      the privacy policy is not agreed to by default, i.e. the
                      user MUST explicitly agree to them.

                      4. `service-desc` or `service-doc`: A link to the API definition.
                      Use `service-desc` for machine-readable API definition and 
                      `service-doc` for human-readable API definition.
                      Required if full OGC API compatibility is desired.

                      5. `conformance`: A link to the Conformance declaration
                      (see `/conformance`). 
                      Required if full OGC API compatibility is desired.

                      6. `data`: A link to the collections (see `/collections`).
                      Required if full OGC API compatibility is desired.

      summary: Supported openEO versions
      operationId: connect
      description: |-
        Lists all implemented openEO versions supported by the
        service provider. This endpoint is the Well-Known URI
        (see [RFC 5785](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785)) for openEO.

        This allows a client to easily identify the most recent openEO
        implementation it supports. By default, a client SHOULD connect to the
        most recent production-ready version it supports. If not available, the
        most recent supported version of *all* versions SHOULD be connected to.
        Clients MAY let users choose to connect to versions that are not
        production-ready or outdated.
        The most recent version is determined by comparing the version numbers
        according to rules from [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
        especially [§11](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11). Any pair of API
        versions in this list MUST NOT be equal according to Semantic Versioning.

        The Well-Known URI is the entry point for clients and users, so make
        sure it is permanent and easy to use and remember. Clients MUST NOT
        require the well-known path (`./well-known/openeo`) in the URL that is
        specified by a user to connect to the back-end. A client MUST request
        `https://example.com/.well-known/openeo` if a user tries to connect to
        `https://example.com`. If the request to the well-known URI fails, the
        client SHOULD try to request the capabilities at `/` from
        `https://example.com`.

        **This URI MUST NOT be versioned as the other endpoints.** If your API
        is available at `https://example.com/api/v1.0`, the Well-Known URI
        SHOULD be located at `https://example.com/.well-known/openeo` and the
        URI users connect to SHOULD be `https://example.com`.

        Clients MAY get additional information (e.g. title or description) about
        a back-end from the most recent version that has the `production` flag
        set to `true`.

        Lists supported input and output file formats.
        *Input* file formats specify which file a back-end can *read* from.
        *Output* file formats specify which file a back-end can *write* to.


        The response to this request is an object listing all available input
        and output file formats separately with their parameters and additional
        data. This endpoint does not include the supported secondary web
        services.


        **Note**: Format names and parameters MUST be fully aligned with the
        GDAL codes if available, see [GDAL Raster
        Formats](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html) and [OGR Vector
        Formats](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html). It is OPTIONAL to
        support all output format parameters supported by GDAL. Some file
        formats not available through GDAL may be defined centrally for openEO.
        Custom file formats or parameters MAY be defined.


        The format descriptions must describe how the file formats relate to 
        data cubes. Input file formats must describe how the files have to be
        structured to be transformed into data cubes. Output file formats must
        describe how the data cubes are stored at the back-end and how the 
        resulting file structure looks like.


        Back-ends MUST NOT support aliases, for example it is not allowed to
        support `geotiff` instead of `gtiff`. Nevertheless, openEO Clients MAY
        translate user input input for convenience (e.g. translate `geotiff` to
        `gtiff`). Also, for a better user experience the back-end can specify a
        `title`.


        Format names are allowed to be *case insensitive* throughout the API.

        To get the full metadata for a collection clients MUST
        request `GET /collections/{collection_id}`.

                      1-2 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses,
                      aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with
                      the two 250 m MODIS bands is one additional layer, the
                      Surface Reflectance QC 250 m band. For each pixel, a
                      value is selected from all the acquisitions within the
                      8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel

      summary: OpenID Connect authentication
      operationId: authenticate-oidc
      description: >-
        Lists the supported [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/)
        providers (OP). OpenID Providers MUST support [OpenID Connect
        Discovery](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).


        It is highly RECOMMENDED to implement OpenID Connect for public services
        in favor of Basic authentication.


        openEO clients MUST use the **access token** as part of the Bearer token
        for authorization in subsequent API calls (see also the information
        about Bearer tokens in this document). Clients MUST NOT use the id token
        or the authorization code. The access token provided by an OpenID
        Provider does not necessarily provide information about the issuer (i.e. the
        OpenID provider) and therefore a prefix MUST be added to the Bearer
        Token sent in subsequent API calls to protected endpoints. The Bearer
        Token sent to protected endpoints MUST consist of the authentication
        method (here `oidc`), the provider ID and the access token itself. All
        separated by a forward slash `/`. The provider ID corresponds to the
        value specified for `id` for each provider in the response body of this
        endpoint.  The header in subsequent API calls for a provider with `id`
        `ms` would look as follows: `Authorization: Bearer oidc/ms/TOKEN`
        (replace `TOKEN` with the actual access token received from the OpenID
        Provider).


        Back-ends MAY request user information ([including Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims))
        from the [OpenID Connect Userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
        using the access token (without the prefix described above). Therefore,
        both openEO client and openEO back-end are relying parties (clients) to
        the OpenID Provider.

        Checks the credentials provided through [HTTP Basic Authentication
        according to RFC 7617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617) and returns
        an access token for valid credentials.


        The credentials (username and password) MUST be sent in the HTTP header
        `Authorization` with type `Basic` and the Base64 encoded string
        consisting of username and password separated by a double colon `:`. The
        header would look as follows for username `user` and password `pw`:
        `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwdw==`.


        The access token has to be used in the Bearer token for authorization in
        subsequent API calls (see also the information about Bearer tokens in
        this document). The access token returned by this request MUST NOT be
        provided with `basic//` prefix, but the Bearer Token sent in subsequent
        API calls to protected endpoints MUST be prefixed with `basic//`. The
        header in subsequent API calls would look as follows: `Authorization:
        Bearer basic//TOKEN` (replace `TOKEN` with the actual access token).


        It is RECOMMENDED to implement this authentication method for non-public
        services only.

        Validates a user-defined process without executing it. A user-defined process is
        considered valid unless the `errors` array in the response contains at
        least one error.

        Checks whether the process graph is schematically correct and the
        processes are supported by the back-end. It MUST also check the
        arguments against the schema, but checking whether the arguments are
        adequate in the context of data is OPTIONAL. For example, a non-existing
        band name may get rejected only by a few back-ends.
        The validation MUST NOT throw an error for unresolvable process parameters.

        Back-ends MUST validate the process graph. Validating the corresponding
        metadata is OPTIONAL.

        Errors that usually occur during processing MAY NOT get reported, e.g.
        if a referenced file is accessible at the time of execution.

        Back-ends can either report all errors at once or stop the validation
        once they found the first error. 

        Please note that a validation always returns with HTTP status code 200.
        Error codes in the 4xx and 5xx ranges MUST be returned only when the
        general validation request is invalid (e.g. server is busy or properties
        in the request body are missing), but never if an error was found during
        validation of the user-defined process (e.g. an unsupported process).

        the request body. If the values don't match, the value for `id` gets
        replaced with the value from the `process_graph_id` parameter in the

        [OGC WMS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms),
        [OGC WCS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs),
        [OGC API - Features](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features)
        or [XYZ tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames).
        The response is an object of all available secondary web service protocols
        with their supported configuration settings and expected process parameters.

        * The configuration settings for the service SHOULD be defined upon
          creation of a service and the service will be set up accordingly.
        * The process parameters SHOULD be referenced (with a `from_parameter`
          reference) in the user-defined process that is used to compute web service
          results.
          The appropriate arguments MUST be provided to the user-defined process,
          usually at runtime from the context of the web service,
          For example, a map service such as a WMS would
          need to inject the spatial extent into the user-defined process so that the
          back-end can compute the corresponding tile correctly.

        To improve interoperability between back-ends common names for the
        services SHOULD be used, e.g. the abbreviations used in the official
        [OGC Schema Repository](http://schemas.opengis.net/) for the respective
        services.

        Service names are allowed to be *case insensitive* throughout the API.

        Lists signed URLs pointing to the processed files after the batch job
        has finished. Back-ends may also point to intermediate results after the
        job has stopped due to an error.
        

        The response includes additional metadata. It is a valid
        [STAC Item (version 0.9.0)](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/item-spec)
        if it has spatial and temporal references included.


        URL signing is a way to protect files from unauthorized access with a
        key in the URL instead of HTTP header based authorization. The URL
        signing key is similar to a password and its inclusion in the URL allows
        to download files using simple GET requests supported by a wide range of
        programs, e.g. web browsers or download managers. Back-ends are
        responsible to generate the URL signing keys and to manage their
        appropriate expiration. The back-end MAY indicate an expiration time by
        setting the `expires` property.


        If processing has not finished yet requests to this endpoint MUST be
        rejected with openEO error `JobNotFinished`.

        Adds a batch job to the processing queue to compute the results.

        The result will be stored in the format specified in the process.
        To specify the format use a process such as `save_result`.

        This endpoint has no effect if the job status is already `queued` or
        `running`. In particular, it doesn't restart a running job. Processing
        MUST be canceled before to restart it.

        The job status is set to `queued`, if processing doesn't start
        instantly.

        * Once the processing starts the status is set to `running`.
        * Once the data is available to download the status is set to
        `finished`.
        * Whenever an error occurs during processing, the status MUST be set to
        `error`.

        Back-ends SHOULD reject queueing jobs with openEO error `PaymentRequired`,
        if the back-end is able to detect that the budget is too low to fully
        process the request. Alternatively, back-ends MAY provide partial results
        once reaching the budget. If none of the alternatives is feasible, the
        results are discarded. Thus, client SHOULD warn users that reaching the
        budget may lead to partial or no results at all.

                      (east-most box edge).

            It is RECOMMENDED to provide links with the following
            `rel` (relation) types:

            1. `root` and `parent`: URL to the data discovery endpoint at `/collections`.

            3. `example`: Links to examples of processes that use this collection.

            4. `derived_from`: Allows linking to the data this collection was derived from.

            5. `cite-as`: [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) links should be added. DOIs can also be 
            listed in the STAC fields `sci:doi` and `sci:publications`, see the [STAC scientific
            extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/scientific)
            for more details.

            6. `latest-version`: If a collection has been marked as deprecated, a link SHOULD
            point to the latest version of the collection. The relation types `predecessor-version`
            (link to older version) and `successor-version` (link to newer version) can also be used
            to show the relation between versions.

            7. `alternate`: An alternative representation of the collection.
            For example, this could be the collection available through another

            Summaries are either a unique set of all available
            values *or* statistics. Statistics by default only
            specify the range (minimum and maximum values), but
            can optionally be accompanied by additional
            statistical values. The range can specify the
            potential range of values, but it is recommended to be
            as precise as possible. The set of values MUST contain
            at least one element and it is strongly RECOMMENDED to
            list all values. It is recommended to list as many
            properties as reasonable so that consumers get a full
            overview of the Collection. Properties that are
            covered by the Collection specification (e.g.
            `providers` and `license`) SHOULD NOT be repeated in the

              elements:

              * licensor: The organization that is licensing the dataset under
              the license specified in the collection's license field.

              * producer: The producer of the data is the provider that
              initially captured and processed the source data, e.g. ESA for
              Sentinel-2 data.

              * processor: A processor is any provider who processed data to a
              derived product.

              * host: The host is the actual provider offering the data on their
              storage. There SHOULD be no more than one host, specified as last
              element of the list.

            1. `latest-version`: If a process has been marked as deprecated, a link SHOULD
            point to the preferred version of the process. The relation types `predecessor-version`
            (link to older version) and `successor-version` (link to newer version) can also be used
            to show the relation between versions.

            2. `example`: Links to examples of other processes that use this process.

            3. `cite-as`: For all DOIs associated with the process, the respective DOI
            links SHOULD be added.

            For additional relation types see also the lists of

        The following options are pre-defined by the openEO API, but additional
        namespaces may be introduced by back-ends or in a future version of the API.
        
        * `null` (default): Checks both user-defined and pre-defined processes,
           but prefers user-defined processes if both are available.
           This allows users to add missing pre-defined processes for portability,
           e.g. common processes from [processes.openeo.org](https://processes.openeo.org)
           that have a process graph included.
           It is RECOMMENDED to log the namespace selected by the back-end for debugging purposes.
        * `backend`: Uses exclusively the pre-defined processes listed at `GET /processes`.
        * `user`: Uses exclusively the user-defined processes listed at `GET /process_graphs`.

        If multiple processes with the same identifier exist, Clients SHOULD
        inform the user that it's recommended to select a namespace.
    process_id:

        The identifier for the process. It MUST be unique across its namespace

        See the chapter ['Schemas' in 'Defining Processes'](#section/Processes/Defining-Processes) for more information.

        The following more complex JSON Schema keywords SHOULD NOT be used:
        `if`, `then`, `else`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly`, `dependencies`, `minProperties`, `maxProperties`, `patternProperties`, `multipleOf`.

        JSON Schemas SHOULD always be dereferenced (i.e. all `$refs` should be resolved). This allows clients to consume the schemas much better.
        Clients are not expected to support dereferencing `$refs`.

  parameters:
    pagination_limit:
      name: limit
      description: |-
        This parameter enables pagination for the endpoint and specifies the maximum number of
        elements that arrays in the top-level object (e.g. collections, processes, batch jobs,
        secondary services, log entries, etc.) are allowed to contain.
        The `links` array MUST NOT be paginated like the resources,
        but instead contain links related to the paginated resources
        or the pagination itself (e.g. a link to the next page).
        If the parameter is not provided or empty, all elements are returned.

        Pagination is OPTIONAL: back-ends or clients may not support it.
        Therefore it MUST be implemented in a way that clients not supporting
        pagination get all resources regardless. Back-ends not supporting
        pagination MUST return all resources.

        If the response is paginated, the `links` array MUST be used to communicate the
        links for browsing the pagination with pre-defined `rel` types. See the `links` array schema
        for supported `rel` types.
        Backend implementations can, unless specified otherwise, use all kind of pagination techniques,
        depending on what is supported best by their infrastructure: page-based, offset-based, token-based
        or something else. The clients SHOULD use whatever is specified
        in the links with the corresponding `rel` types.
