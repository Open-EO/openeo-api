    "description": "Filters the bands in the data cube so that bands that don't match any of the criteria are dropped from the data cube. The data cube is expected to have only one dimension of type `bands`. Fails with a `DimensionMissing` error if no such dimension exists.\n\nThe following criteria can be used to select bands:\n\n* `bands`: band name (e.g. `B01` or `B8A`)\n* `common_names`: common band names (e.g. `red` or `nir`)\n* `wavelengths`: ranges of wavelengths in micrometres (μm) (e.g. 0.5 - 0.6)\n\nTo keep algorithms interoperable it is recommended to prefer the common bands names or the wavelengths over collection and/or back-end specific band names.\n\nIf multiple criteria are specified, any of them must match and not all of them, i.e. they are combined with an OR-operation. If no criteria is specified, the `BandFilterParameterMissing` exception must be thrown.\n\n**Important:** The order of the specified array defines the order of the bands in the data cube, which can be important for subsequent processes. If multiple bands are matched by a single criterion (e.g. a range of wavelengths), they are ordered alphabetically by band names. Bands without names have an arbitrary order.",
