    "description": "Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The NDVI is computed as *(nir - red) / (nir + red)*.\n\nThe `data` parameter expects a raster data cube with a dimension of type `bands`, which has at least two bands with the common names `red` and `nir`. The common names for each band are specified in the collection's band metadata and are *not* equal to the band names. The process returns a raster data cube an additional band that holds the computed values. The newly created band is named `ndvi` by default, but the name can be changed with the `name` parameter.\n\nThis process is very similar to the process ``normalized_difference()``, but determines the bands automatically based on the common names (`red`/`nir`) specified in the metadata.",
