    "description": "Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The NDVI is computed as *(nir - red) / (nir + red)*.\n\nThe `data` parameter expects a raster data cube with two bands that have the common names `red` and `nir` assigned. The process returns a raster data cube with two bands being replaced with a new band that holds the computed values. The newly created band is named `ndvi` by default. This name can be changed with the `name` parameter.\n\nThis process is very similar to the process ``normalized_difference()``, but determines the bands automatically based on the common name (`red`/`nir`) specified in the metadata.",
