The normalized difference is computed as *(x - y) / (x + y)*.\n\nThis process could be used for a number of remote sensing indices such as:\n\n* [NDVI](https://eos.com/ndvi/): `x` = NIR band, `y` = red band\n* [NDWI](https://eos.com/ndwi/): `x` = NIR band, `y` = SWIR band\n* [NDSI](https://eos.com/ndsi/): `x` = green band, `y` = SWIR band\n\nSome back-ends may have native processes such as ``ndvi()`` available for convenience.",
